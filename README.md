# Majorpodo

> A podcast server that uses metadata from static audio files

Given a directory, Majorpodo will serve the audio files it finds there over HTTP
along with webpages and RSS feeds generated from the metadata inside those
files.

Use it to host your own podcast, or provide a means to get files [downloaded
from BBC radio](https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer) into your podcast
client for convenient personal use (Majorpodo supports password protection).
